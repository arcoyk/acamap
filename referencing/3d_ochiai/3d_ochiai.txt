Abstract
The essence of levitation technology is the countervailing of gravity. It is known that an ultrasound standing wave is
capable of suspending small particles at its sound pressure nodes. The acoustic axis of the ultrasound beam in conventional
studies was parallel to the gravitational force, and the levitated objects were manipulated along the fixed axis (i.e. onedimensionally) by controlling the phases or frequencies of bolted Langevin-type transducers. In the present study, we
considered extended acoustic manipulation whereby millimetre-sized particles were levitated and moved threedimensionally by localised ultrasonic standing waves, which were generated by ultrasonic phased arrays. Our manipulation
system has two original features. One is the direction of the ultrasound beam, which is arbitrary because the force acting
toward its centre is also utilised. The other is the manipulation principle by which a localised standing wave is generated at
an arbitrary position and moved three-dimensionally by opposed and ultrasonic phased arrays. We experimentally
confirmed that expanded-polystyrene particles of 0.6 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm in diameter could be manipulated by our
proposed method.

Introduction
Ultrasonic levitation method has been used to levitate
lightweight particles [1], small creatures [2], and water droplets
[3]. The principle of acoustic levitation was mathematically
explained by Gor’kov [4] and Nyborg [5]. The potential energy U
of an ultrasound standing wave is given by.

The acoustic axis coincides with the z axis, and p(x, y) is the
cross-sectional sound pressure distribution. B is given by 3(r 2
r0)/(2r+r0), where r and r0 are the densities of a small sphere and
the medium, respectively; c is given by b/b0, where b and b0 are
the compression ratios of the small sphere and the medium,
respectively; c is the speed of sound in the medium; and l is the
wavelength of ultrasound. The force F acting on a sphere of
volume V is obtained by F = 2V =U. This principle has been
examined using bolted Langevin-type transducers with fixed
acoustic axes.

where pm, n(x, y) is the sound pressure at the focal point from the (m,

of the focal point was 0.5 mm, and the refresh rate was 1 kHz.

The figure shows that small spheres gravitate toward the acoustic
axis of the ultrasound beam at its nodes.
The detailed specifications of the phased array (shown in
Figure 2) are as follows. It consisted of 285 transducers arranged in
a 1706170 mm2 square area and designed to generate a single
focal point by adequate control of their phase differences. The
resonant frequency was 40 kHz, and the sound pressure at the
peak of the focal point was as high as 2600 Pa (RMS) when the

Levitation Principle
Whymark [8] investigated the suspending force of the acoustic
levitation and showed that the force Fx vertical to the acoustic
beam is weaker than the force Fz parallel to the acoustic beam.
Here, we discuss how a small polystyrene sphere can be levitated
in air by the force per unit volume. We suppose that y = 0 and

R = 200 mm. The 25-kHz phased array consists of 100 transducers (16-mm diameter, T2516A1, Nippon Ceramic Co., Ltd.). The
sound pressure at the peak of the focal point is 900 Pa RMS
(estimated) when the focal length R = 200 mm. Using the 25-kHz
phased arrays, the suspending force is much smaller while the size
of the focal point is larger. In this study, we primarily use the 40kHz phased arrays to obtain a larger suspending force.
The size and weight of a single phased array are 1961965 cm3
and 0.6 kg, respectively. It consists of two circuit boards. One is an
array board of ultrasonic transducers and the other is a driving
board, including an FPGA and amplifiers (shown in Figure 2).
They are connected electrically to each other by pin connectors.
The phased array is controlled by a single PC via USB. The
control application is developed in C++ on Windows. The PC
sends the data including the coordinates of the focal point and
output intensity to the driving board. The driving board receives
the data, calculates adequate time delays for the individual
transducers, and generates the driving signals that are sent to the
transducers via the amplifiers. Modifying the time-delay calculation algorithm changes the distribution of the acoustic-potential
field. The output intensity is varied using PWM control of the
driving signal.

z = 0.25l (i.e. a node). The x component Fx/V is therefore
obtained by determining the gradient of Eq. (1):

A polystyrene sphere can be levitated by this force if its density is
less than Fx/Vg, where g = 9.8 m/s2 is the gravitational acceleration. The speed of sound is 340 m/s. The amplitude A generated
by two phased arrays has a maximum value of 5200 Pa (RMS)
when the focal length R = 200 mm, and w = 20 mm. Fx/Vg has a
peak value of 5.06103 kg/m3 at x < 20.2 w. This value is greater
than the density of polystyrene, and it is therefore expected that a
small sphere of polystyrene would be levitated even when the
ultrasound beam is perpendicular to the gravitational force.

Implementation
We developed our manipulation system with four modules of
phased array, as shown in Figure 3. The surrounded area is
5206520 mm2. We placed the phased arrays facing each other.
We have two options of phased arrays with different frequencies
(40 and 25 kHz). The position of the focal point is digitally
controlled with a resolution of 1/16 of the wavelength (approximately 0.5 mm for the 40-kHz ultrasound) and can be refreshed
at 1 kHz. The 40-kHz phased array consists of 285 transducers
(10-mm diameter, T4010A1, Nippon Ceramic Co., Ltd.) arranged
in a 1706170 mm2 square area. The sound pressure at the peak of
the focal point is 2585 Pa RMS (measured) when the focal length

Experimental Setup on Stability
We examined the stability of the manipulation by measuring the
duration of the cyclic movement at different frequencies. The test
was conducted using two types of particles, namely expandedpolystyrene spheres of diameters 0.6 mm, 1.0 mm, and 2.0 mm.
In each trial, a single particle was set at the third node along one of
the acoustic axes (x axis) from the intersection of the ultrasound
beams. All the directions of movement (i.e. x and y along the
acoustic axes, and z perpendicular to them) were tested. The focal

point is set in the center of workspace. The labels of axis are shown in the figure: x-axis and z-axis are parallel to the device plane and y-axis is vertical
to the device plane. We inserted the particles at the third node of beams that is parallel to x-axis in the stability experiments.

compared to using a single beam. When the beam moves through
a mass of particles, the particles are scooped up and held in the
beam as shown in Figure 4 (right).

Results

Stability
The experimental results are shown in Figure 5 and 6. We
moved an expanded-polystyrene particle cyclically back and forth
for each trial at the maximum displacement A = 1.5 cm and the
frequency f [Hz] controlled in steps of 1 Hz. The particle fell from
the acoustic beam after a while. The results are shown as the
average duration of suspension [s] of five trials vs. the maximum
acceleration of the motion [cm/s2] both in Figure 5 and 6. The
maximum acceleration a [m/s2] was calculated as a = A(2pf)2.

Levitation and Manipulation
Multiple ultrasound beams can be overlapped as shown in
Figure 4 (left). The expanded-polystyrene particles are trapped at
the nodes of both ultrasound beams. The interval between the
trapped particles is about 4 mm, which is about half the
wavelength of a 40-kHz ultrasound. It can be observed that the
particles are more stably levitated using this configuration

Figure 5 is for different sizes of a particle (0.6 mm, 1.0 mm, and
2.0 mm) and Figure 6 is for different directions of the movement
(x, y, and z axes) of a 0.6-mm-diameter particle.
Figure 6 shows that manipulation along y axis was more stable
than the others. We speculate that the manipulations along x and z
axes strongly suffer from the discontinuity of the driving signals in
changing the focal length. Figure 5 shows that the 0.6-mmdiameter particles are more stable than the 2.0-mm-diameter
particles at higher accelerations. This suggests that larger particles
tend to fall from the nodes of the standing wave. One possible
explanation is as follows. The shape of the potential field within
the nodes of the standing wave affects the stability of movements.
In a cone-shaped potential field, a particle suffers from a
centripetal force which elicits the vibration. This vibration
decreases the stability.
Next, the work space was studied. In the case of movement
along one of the acoustic axes, the manipulated particles could
approach the ultrasound array to within 60 mm, but fell when
they approached nearer. In the case of the movement perpendicular to the acoustic axes, the particles at the more distant nodes fell
earlier when they moved away from the centre of the system. A
particle at the intersection of the ultrasound beams fell when it
came to within 330 mm of the centre.

This method is applicable to the industrial fabricating for the
manipulation purpose, graphical application for floating screen,
medical application for evaporation, and so on.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated an extended acoustic
manipulation by which millimetre-sized particles can be levitated
and moved three-dimensionally by localised ultrasonic standing
waves generated by ultrasonic phased arrays. In addition to the
presented examples, we also tested other small objects such as a
feather and droplets of alcohol and a colloidal solution.
In a future work, we will use 25 kHz transducers instead of the
40 kHz type. Then the 4-mm node intervals by 40 kHz
transducers will be extended to 8 mm. This would enable the
manipulation of larger particles.
It has not escaped our notice that our developed method for
levitation under gravity suggests the possibility of developing a
technology for handling objects under microgravity.

Discussion
There are some factors to be considered in choosing the
manipulation target, namely the size and material. The size of the
manipulation target is determined by the distribution of the
potential energy, and a light material is required. The internal
force is also an important factor in selecting the material; for
example the electrostatic force determines the maximum number
of particles that can be at a single node, and the surface tension of
the fluid determines the size of droplets that can be levitated.
