Figure 1: We propose POVeye, a user interface solution that enables extensive visualization of multiple viewing angles of a
product that can provide representative description of its material color and texture. We focus to minimalize user input task,
and to provide interactive visualization of the product that can be easily embedded into standard web platforms.
ABSTRACT

ACM Classification Keywords

We present POVeye, a method to help users in capturing
and creating visualization of products for extensive
representation of the product’s material color and texture.
POVeye achieve this by providing realistic images captured
from various angles, which are positioned correctly based
on the calculated geometrical centroid. As input, users
simply provide a video or multiple images of the product
taken by any camera from arbitrary angles, without
requiring any pre-calibration. POVeye provides an interface
that shows object-centric camera positions alongside with
image taken from respective camera angle. Users are able to
either manually browse through automatically detected
camera positions, or visualize the product by automatically
detected view-angle path. POVeye leverages Structurefrom-Motion (SfM) approach to obtain camera-object map.
Our approach is unique from other solutions by preserving
realistic imaging condition. We observe that visualization
of products from different angles that provide information
of light reflection and refraction potentially helps users to
identify materials, and further perceive quality of a product.

INTRODUCTION

Complex real lighting conditions and viewing angle effects
on material color and texture are highly relevant aesthetic
features of a product. This particular aspect has been proven
to have strong impacts on customers’ perceived quality of a
product. For the e-commerce industry, representing a
product’s visual information through images are crucial, as
costumers’ decision process involves perceived visual
information. Moreover, misleading visual information or
excessive usages of subjective text descriptions potentially
cause costumers to hesitate buying online, or return the
delivered merchandise due to mismatched expectations.
Overall, this may cause bad user experience, pose negative
marketing for merchants, and increase operational costs.
SfM based approaches have been widely used to obtain 3D
model of objects [1,2,3]. Depending on the input quality,
the aggregated point clouds are often very sparse. To obtain
usable 3D model for better object’s representation, point
clouds and texture inpainting are often required. However,
it causes significant information loss on lighting effects. In
this work, we create an interface design to provide realistic
visualization of the object relative to its viewing angle and
lighting condition without any post-processing or rendering.

approach that only requires minimal user actions which
involves video or multiple images capture using any camera
from arbitrary angles. POVeye software implements basic
SfM and further extends it to: 1) obtain key image frames
that represents correctly detected viewing angle achieved
from 2D features matching, 2) obtain camera-object 3D
relative position map, 3) obtain object’s center-of-geometry
that serve as visualization’s pivotal point, and 4) obtain
optimal camera viewing trajectory to produce automatic
animation that can be easily portable to standard web page
as gif or motion jpeg. In this work, we contribute to HCI
community by presenting our user interface design concept,
prototype implementation details, as well as brief
evaluations of POVeye. We also discuss limitations, and
share our plans for future iteration of this work.

DISCUSSION

Users are able to tell the difference of certain materials by
observing different light reflections and/or refractions in
images captured from certain viewing angles. As an
example, in the wristwatch visualization, users are able to
easily obtain information on how the metal, glass, and
leather’s look and feel change relative to illumination and
viewing angle. Using the simultaneous camera-object
visualization, users are given awareness on the distance and
angle of the camera relative to the object. Therefore, users
are provided with better representation of the actual
product’s visual information to help their decision process.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

POVEYE IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION

We presented POVeye, a user interface solution that enables
extensive visualization of multiple viewing angles of a
product. The visualization also provides intuitive 3D map
of camera-object relative position to give users full
awareness of the image spatial contexts. We reported our
implementation approach and visualization results of
several representative objects. In future iteration of this
work, we plan to improve towards more effortless capture
and refine the UI. We also plan to conduct rigorous user
study to evaluate effectiveness of POVeye approach, and to
provide design guidelines for other researchers and
practitioners who are interested in applying our solution.

POVeye consists of two main components: 1)
implementation of SfM approach, and 2) user interface part
which provides interactive visualization of the product. We
highlight our approach in Figure 1. In order to give better
visual information in each viewing angle, we designed
POVeye UI to have a static pivotal point of the object, i.e.,
the point of origin where x,y,z-coordinates are {0,0,0}
should be the same across images. We define this static
pivotal point as the center-of-geometry (i.e., centroid or
barycenter) calculated from the aggregated 3D point clouds,
which we treated as the centroid of a finite set of k
points x1,x2, …, xk in Rn [4]:
