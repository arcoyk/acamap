For instance,
given the time and the previous

it may be possible for the system to predict
the final destination

who is moving

it is rare that these techniques

The problem
is that technology

A transponding
badge can also be used as a key, authenticating
itself on
entering
a secure area. The problem
with a remotely
operated
key is that the
signals it sends can be recorded
and played back later to masquerade
as the
same key. By using
a randomized
challenge/response
protocol
from
the
secure area to the key, good protection
can be given against
this kind of
forgery.
The unforgeable
key can of course be stolen, but so can a conventional
key; yet a badge offers additional
advantages.
