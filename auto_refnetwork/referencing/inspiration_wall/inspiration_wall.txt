ABSTRACT

Collaborative idea generation leverages social interactions
and knowledge sharing to spark diverse associations and produce creative ideas. Information exploration systems expand
the current context by suggesting novel but related concepts.
In this paper we introduce InspirationWall, an unobtrusive
display that leverages speech recognition and information exploration to enhance an ongoing idea generation session with
automatically retrieved concepts that relate to the conversation. We evaluated the system in six idea generation sessions
of 20 minutes with small groups of two people. Preliminary results suggest that InspirationWall contrasts the decay
of idea productivity over time and can thus represent an effective way to enhance idea generation activities.

INTRODUCTION

in a variety of tasks [6]. Group brainstorming can be effective in generating creative ideas as suggested by cognitive approaches [3], and technology may help minimizing the effect
of negative social processes [5]. A beneficial feature in group
brainstorming is the ability to detect the context and content
of the brainstorming through utterances of participants. IdeaExpander [14] is a tool to support group brainstorming by
intelligently selecting pictorial stimuli based on the group’s
conversation on a chat. The pictures generally enhanced performance as measured by both originality and diversity of
ideas [15]. Less investigated are face to face systems in group
sessions that suggest keywords instead of pictures. Systems
suggesting keywords and topics have recently been applied
successfully to improve exploratory search processes [1, 10].
Such systems predict the current intent model of the user in
the exploration and suggest possible explorations. These approaches have also been found useful in avoiding keyword
input by selecting and manipulating suggested keywords by
touch [8]. The present work investigate further alternative input modalities such as speech to text that permit the system to
run in the background without interrupting the creative process but providing a continuous resource.

Collecting and navigating through information is an important phase in creative processes [13], which fosters associative and inspirational learning [2]. Previous work that sought
to support for example brainstorming referred to the semantic
network structure of human memory, where concepts feature
as nodes with associative links [15]. In brainstorming, one
cognitive operation to generate ideas is to retrieve concepts
from associative memory. Expanding the current context of
topics has been investigated through topic suggestion algorithms designed to generate candidate topics that are novel
but related to the current context [9]. As brainstorming is
often a collaborative practice, recent creativity systems support groups. Groups generally perform better than individuals

Figure 2. Left: Two participants in a brainstorming session. Right: A screen capture from the InspirationWall interface.

For example, an article about ”relevance feedback for information retrieval” could be described with a set of keywords,
such as ”information retrieval”, ”relevance feedback”, ”implicit feedback”, ”web search”, and so on. In addition, we
index the text of the articles that is used to retrieve an initially
relevant set of documents from which the knowledge-graph
is constructed.

SYSTEM DESIGN

InspirationWall is a non-intrusive source of diverse ideas
(Figure 1). It was designed as a low-key visual aid, as to
not interfere with the user’s idea generation process. InspirationWall continuously monitors the discussions through
a conference microphone and the input to the system is
recorded from users natural interaction via speech recognition. Speech recognition is performed in real-time using
Googles implementation of the HTML5 Web Speech API
[16].

The user’s query consists of one or more words detected via
the speech recognition system. A set of keywords detected
are called preference keywords q 2 G in the graph, where
|q| = 1 and qj denotes the preference for keyword j. In our
case no weighting is conducted for the keywords so the preference is uniformly distributed over for the given keywords
in q.

Recognized expressions are processed by an entity-based
keyword suggestion system that returns related keywords by
discovering associated and novel information related to the
input [11]. Returned keywords are then displayed as slowly
crossing the screen from top to bottom as to allow a progressive refreshing of displayed keywords. The graphical interface of Inspiration Wall is minimal: it runs fullscreen with
a black background. Keywords are displayed in white. Every two seconds providing the keyword buffer is not empty
a new keyword appears at the top of the screen at a random
horizontal position and falls slowly towards the bottom of the
screen.

We use the personalized PageRank method [7] to compute the
ranking of the nodes given the q. It can be then formalized as
follows. Let an individual node be denoted as n, and by I(n)
and O(n) denote the set of in-neighbors and out-neighbors of
n in G respectively. Let A be the matrix corresponding to the
graph G, where
Aij =

1
|Oij [ Iij |

if the node i links to the node j or vice versa, and Aij = 0
otherwise. For a given q, the personalized PageRank equation
can be written as

Keyword Suggestion System

As the set of potential keywords matching any part of users’
discussion is likely to be much higher than what can be presented for the user, and the discussion can contain misleading cues due to the natural dialogues that the system listens,
we use a centrality-based ranking of the keywords in a large
knowledge-graph.

v = (1

c)Av + cq,

where c = 0.15 is the teleportation rate. The solution v is
a steady-state distribution of random surfers, where a surfer
teleports at each step to a node n with probability c · q(n),
or moves to a random neighbor otherwise. We compute the
steady distribution by using the power iteration method with
100 iterations.

Intuitively, this approach allows the system to suggest central
keywords that are related to the user input via the knowledgegraph rather than only suggesting keywords directly matching to the input. This can help discovering keywords that
are highly relevant for the input, but at the same time central to the overall discussion [12]. The knowledge-graph G
is undirected and labeled and consists of a disjoint union set
of keywords and documents (called nodes n 2 G) and the
set of edges between the documents and the keywords. Each
keyword in the graph is connected to a document it describes.

The weights of the v are directly used in ranking the keywords. As the size of our knowledge-graph is hundreds of
millions of nodes, the computation is not possible on-line for
the complete graph. To make the PageRank computation feasible with an acceptable latency, we approximate the set of
nodes to be included in the initial graph by using a language

topic X. Two topics were used in the evaluation sessions: (1.)
Robotics, and (2.) Wearable computing.

EVALUATION

Metrics and Results
Quantity of Ideas

We designed an experiment to evaluate the effect of the system on the idea generation process. The goal of the experiment was (1.) to understand if and how InspirationWall
helped small groups generating more ideas, and (2.) to assess
the overall effectiveness of the system as a creativity support
tool using standard metrics.

Since we were interested to check whether our application
influenced the number of ideas generated, we have looked
to the cumulative number of ideas considering time and session (Table 1). In total, the six groups have produced 107
(M = 30.57, SD = 12.24) ideas without external support
and 136 (M = 38.86, SD = 14.99) using InspirationWall.
In Figure 3, it is shown the accumulation of ideas per condition in the sessions, considering intervals of 4 minutes. In
addition, video recordings obtained from the camera placed
between the participants and the InspirationWall display allowed us to count the occurrences of participants looking at
the screen (results shown in Figure 4). It is interesting to observe that the three groups (S1, S3 and S6) that have looked
at the display the most, improved their performance with respect to the baseline condition, presenting a higher number of
generated ideas and a more constant productivity.

Participants

The evaluation was conducted in groups of two persons (Figure 2). We recruited twelve participants (six pairs) with experience in idea generation activities from the computer science
departments of two universities. Three of the participants
were females and the mean age was M = 28.33, SD = 3.98.
To simulate more natural discussions and brainstorming activity, we ensured that participants in the same pair knew each
other. Participants were non-native English speakers from
different countries and cultures (Iran, Canada, Spain, Nepal,
Italy, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Kenya) with a similar level
of proficiency in oral English. Their levels of education were:
25% PhD, 67% Master, 8% Bachelor. Participants received
two movie tickets as a compensation for their participation.

Creativity Support Index

To measure the performance of our system in terms of creativity support, we involved participants in the assessment of
the Creativity Support Index (CSI) [4].

Tasks

We used a within-group design, where groups were asked to
perform two tasks: one with the support of InspirationWall
and one without external support. We counterbalanced by
changing the order in which the two tasks were performed
and the order in which the groups were subjected to each condition.

The task was created to support an idea generation scenario
and formulated as follows: Imagine you have to come up
with novel student projects on topic X. Please generate as
many ideas as possible for new technologies, interaction techniques, methodologies, application scenarios, and so on, that

This index is computed from two sets of six questions and
each question related with a factor. The six factors that compose the CSI are: Collaboration, Enjoyment, Exploration,
Expression, Expressiveness, Immersion and Results Worth
Effort. Each pair of questions are weighted based in pair
wise comparisons of the factors made by each participant.
The result of the CSI was M = 53.36, SD = 13.35. The
most important factors for the participants were Expressiveness (M = 3.58, SD = 1.24) and Exploration (M = 3.83,
SD = 0.94).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Creative ideas are often triggered by unexpected associations.
InspirationWall offers a quiet additional source of information to fuel the activity of collaborative idea generation. This
paper presents the implementation and a preliminary evaluation of such a system. Participants were asked to generate ideas but not explicitly to use or interact with the system
which was simply provided as is. Our study shows that participants that used InspirationWall more – as indicated by the
count and duration of gazing occurrences obtained through
video analysis – tended to generate more ideas in total and
over time. Those results suggest that InspirationWall contrasts the decay of idea productivity over time typical of traditional idea generation sessions. Although the CSI does not
show a high value, it is still above the median value of the
scale, with the most important factors for the participants being Expressiveness and Exploration. Such results confirms
the effectiveness of automatic information exploration and
keyword suggestion on idea generation, opening a variety of
directions for future work, including for example application
to other datasets, and allowing richer interactions with the
system through touch. The novel approach on idea generation support described in this paper, the simple design of our
prototype and the positive results of this preliminary study are
the contributions of our work to the future of digital tools for
creativity support.
