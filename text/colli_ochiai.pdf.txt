It’s very difficult to take the picture as we see this display. The reflection of projector light is difficult to capture in cameras.

1. Introduction
It is a common knowledge that the surface of soap
bubble is a micro membrane. It allows light to pass
through and displays the color on its structure. We developed an ultra thin and flexible BRDF screen using the
mixture of two colloidal liquids. There have been several
researches on dynamic BRDF display[1] in the past.
However, our work is different in several points. Our
membrane screen can be controlled using ultrasonic vibrations. Membrane can change its transparency and
surface states depending on the scales of ultrasonic
waves. Based on these facts, we developed several applications of the membranes such as 3D volume screen.
The combination of the ultrasonic waves and ultra thin
membranes makes more realistic, distinctive, and vivid
imageries on screen. This system contributes to open up
a new path for display engineering with sharp imageries,
transparency, BRDF and flexibility.

2. Design
We developed the first prototype by using soap and
milk. These are colloidal liquids and their molecules
have different sizes and colors. With ultrasonic parametric speakers, we could control their movements (liquids
and particles) on the membranes. If they move with intensity, the reflections change while the membrane
works as a projector screen. Since we can control the
dynamics of the wavelengths, the state of the surface can
be easily changed.

3. Application
First we developed a screen for displaying realistic
material. The display’s state changes in correspondence
to the images the projector shows.
Secondly, we developed the plane based 3D screen
with three membranes using a single projector. (changing frequency 25Hz) The transparency of each membrane is controllable by frequency of the sound from the
parametric speakers. We set the projector and linked it
with the transparency of each membrane.
In addition, we developed polyhedrons made from
these membranes and displayed several images on it.
This system shows that this is useful to flexibly display
3D objects.

4. Future Work
We introduced the first prototype of a new kind of display by using colloidal liquids and a method of controlling them by using ultrasonic waves. Due to its thinness
and transparency, the method could be applied to a variety of cases in using display technologies. The 3Ds
screen and texture screen are exemplary applications of
this system.
Currently our membrane can maintain its surface
(screen) for 5 minutes. However, there are several solutions for this problem and there are rooms for new potential colloidal materials for the use.

With the parametric speakers, this system can make the
screens drastically thinner since it does not need any
additional systems or materials on the screen. The thinness of the screen is approximately 1 micrometer. Since
we could control the state of the surface, we were able to
have several interactions such as piercing a finger
through it or enlarging it by using its elasticity and flexibility.
