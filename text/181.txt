ODUCTION

Througgh the widespreead usage of sm
martphones, wee use social
networrking services in our daily liives. Instagram
m exceeded
500 m
million monthlyy active users in June 2015, exceeding
Twitterr1. Also accordding to the Pew
w Research Centter, 55% of
online adults ages 18 to 29 use Instaagram2. Those pphenomena
imply tthat image-baseed communicaation is emerginng as a new
social media usage pattern. Userss share their eexperiences
with otthers by uploadding photos taggged with the location or
with haashtags. As reecording locatioons with photoos becomes
routinizzed behavior, pprofessional geenres of photoggraphy such
as streeet photographhy, landscape photography, etc., have
been exxtended to amaateurs.

embedded metadata of time and place included therein are
providing meaningful information about each location.
However, the current systems and services do not support
tracking the transition of the location over time. This research
presents a new interface for arranging location pictures
chronologically to make socially created photos to function
as the historic documents that provide meaningful
information about the location.

representative photos of the year at once. Users can trace the
transition of the location, which is the history of the venue.
Browse by time

This section contains photos clustered by a specific period.
This helps users to easily find the specific time of the photos
they’re looking for. Also, users can select the criteria for the
period from the screen’s dropdown menu. Existing services
like Instagram display photographs in descending
chronological order, so it is hard to find the photos of the
past. However, by clustering pictures by period, this interface
allows users to simply browse the photos of the past.

RELATED WORK

Research studies about image displaying system present
interfaces that arrange photos using either temporal criteria
[1, 2] or spatial criteria [3, 5]. Each of these works separate
time and space. Although research applying both temporal
and spatial information has been performed [4], it focuses on
the technological aspect of dynamic scene analysis and
temporal reasoning. This method could be applied in our
works to extract photos from the Internet.

Gallery

If users click the “see more” menu on the browsing screen,
the screen moves to the Gallery screen, which displays all the
photos of the selected area. By scrolling down, users can
skim through the photos (Figure 1C).
CONCLUSION

Compared with the above systems, Histogram contains both
temporal and spatial information simultaneously to trace the
transition of the space. By providing a mobile-optimized
interface for easily uploading photos from the users’
smartphones, we aim to accelerate the voluntary uploading of
photos by people so that the system is run through social
cooperative works.

Reflecting time series and space data simultaneously,
Histogram provides a different view of utilizing usergenerated digital photos as historical records. Based on the
current prototype, we need to collect further image data from
online and develop the system. Also, further studies about
how to select the representative photos and about the visual
display methods, like scrolling down or swiping to browse
the pictures, should be conducted to develop the system.

INTERFACE DESCRIPTION

The interface of Histogram has been subdivided into three
stages: 1) Search; 2) Browse; and 3) the Gallery (Figure 1).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The search page features an adapted map-based interface,
and it also provides general information about the location
(Figure 1A).

This research was supported by the MSIP(Ministry of
Science, ICT and Future Planning), Korea, under the Open
ICT Convergence support program program(IITP-2016R0250-16-1001) supervised by the IITP(Institute for
Information &communications Technology Promotion).

After selecting the venue, at the bottom of the screen, the
‘Histogram Trend’ is presented and contains information
about the number of photos uploaded by year with a line
graph to track changes directly. This helps to discern the
popularity of the spot by the time.

Once the target spot is selected, users can browse the photos
in the browsing screen, which contains three menus: today’s
history, history overview and browse by time (Figure 1B).

Today’s history

The section for today’s history displays the uploaded photo
of the day selected by users. By exposing users’ photos on
the main screen, the system encourages users’ participation.
