ABSTRACT

A novel mechanism of transclusion for collecting and
producing information on the Web, named partial
bookmarking, is proposed. Partial bookmarking allows a
user to collect portions of any web page by making it able
to use for a spatial hypertext, like a web document element,
without the need to duplicate its contents. Whereas the
previous studies involving transclusion required predesigned linkable objects, such as XML elements or HTML
objects, partial bookmarking does not rely on any document
structure. To accomplish partial bookmarking, we enhanced
a conventional web browser with multiple tabs by
introducing the technology of mirroring to display only a
portion of a web page appropriately while factoring in
potential copyright issues.

This approach provides a great advantage in that the user
can collect any portion of a web page, even if it is a part of
an image or a scene within a movie. There is also no
infringement of copyright in producing the spatial hypertext
on the WWW.

PARTIAL BOOKMARKING

Figure 1, in brief, shows an example situation of partial
bookmarking via our early version of the enhanced web
browser. There are two areas: browsing area and authoring
area. The former includes a web browser with multiple tabs,
where the user visits the web page and browses its content
on a web browser, and then selects a single portion of the
web page, e.g. a part of an image and text, which the user is
interested in and wants to access again later. The selected
portion is able to be arranged to create the spatial hypertext
and when the user needs on the latter area. As shown in the
figure, partial bookmarking is proceeded by selecting the
portion and recording it as an element of a spatial hypertext
just as it is.

INTRODUCTION

The World Wide Web (WWW) provides the indispensable
environment for collecting and producing information on a
daily basis. Transclusion [4] is a technique enabling authors
to include portions of existing contents into their own
documents without duplicating any content. We here
propose the mechanism of transclusion, named partial
bookmarking, and introduce an enhanced web browser to
utilize it for authoring a spatial hypertext. Partial
bookmarking makes transclusion available regardless of the
document structure which is presupposed in many previous
studies [2,3] involving modularized documents written in
languages for hypertext such as XML, XLink, or HTML.
Our approach takes a way of mirroring a portion of a web
page from the user’s web browser to a spatial hypertext.

Partial Bookmark

To identify the portion of the web page, the shortcut, called
partial bookmark, is composed of two types of information:
location and action information. The former includes the
URL of the web page and the coordinates of the region of
the portion on a web browser. The latter includes the
information about the sequence of events that occurred on
the web browser, e.g., button down or scroll down, which
were performed when the user found the portion including
the required information. Figure 2 shows the version of
DTD defining the syntax and structure to represent the

Figure 2. DTD of partial bookmark

The spatial hypertext consists of some partial bookmarks
and their layout information on the authoring area. The
reference web pages for the spatial hypertext are always
loaded on the tabbed windows of the web browser.
Premising the use of the enhanced web browser to see the
spatial hypertext, the user can broadcast it publicly without
copyright infringement.

partial bookmark in XML. The element PB is the top
element of partial bookmark. It contains two sub elements,
i.e. Location_information and Action_information, for
recording the pieces of the information explained above.
From the aspect of browsing the web pages, the user has to
perform a considerable number of actions on the web
browser in order to find useful information. If the portion is
found after performing these actions, the URL of the web
page is mandatory but insufficient to identify the portion.
Our idea is to reproduce the actions on the web browser,
which were performed by the user when s/he visited the
web page, and to display only the portion on the web
browser. Note that there is no necessity to analyze the web
page structure and to record any source document of the
reference web page for the partial bookmark. The portion to
be bookmarked is shown in the spatial hypertext as it is
displayed on the web browser.

CONCLUSION

We proposed a partial bookmarking which is different from
the previous mechanisms of transclusion premising the
document structure of the web page. In the preliminary case
study using our early version of the enhanced web browser,
the subjects tended to prefer to use the partial bookmark
usage similar to the ordinary bookmark usage. Even when
the same web pages were given as the reference web pages,
the subjects could create unique spatial hypertexts.

The Enhanced Web Browser

Figure 3 shows the architecture of the enhanced web
browser. The browsing area allows the user to select the
portions of any web page for creating partial bookmarks.
The latter plays the role of an authoring place of a spatial
hypertext, where a window, named p-window, for the
portion identified by the partial bookmark can be arranged.

In the figure, each p-window is a window mirroring the
portion of a web page, which is referred by a partial
bookmark. For mirroring the portion, PB handler uses the
techniques [1,5] of intervening image/event-information
between the user and the web browser. Its primary role is to
collect the location and action information when the user
selects the portion on the web browser for partial
bookmarking. Another role is to reproduce the events in the
partial bookmark for mirroring only the portion identified
by this bookmark to the p-window from the reference web
page on the tabbed window. Thus the dynamic changes on
the web page are always updated on the p-window. When
the user is aware of the layout changes of the reference web
page, s/he can revisit the page through the tabbed window
to revise the partial bookmark.
