ABSTRACT

We present a printing technique that controls the thickness
of objects by increasing and decreasing the amount of
material extruded during printing. Using this technique,
printers can dynamically control thickness and output thicker
objects without a staircase effect. This technique allows
users to print aesthetic pattern sheets and objects that are
tactile without requiring any new hardware. This extends the
capabilities of fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers
in a simple way. We describe a method of generating and
calculating a movement path for printing tactile sheets, and
demonstrate the usage and processing of example objects.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper, we present a technique that controls the
thickness of objects by increasing and decreasing the amount
of material and by moving the position of the printer head in
the height direction (Figure 1a). Using this technique,
printers can dynamically control thickness and output thicker
objects without a staircase effect. Our technique consists
only of software that can generate corresponding Gcode; this
does not require any new hardware or improvements to the
printer. We utilize this technique to print a tactile sheet
(Figure 1b). This sheet has a smooth tactile sense because it
is not printed layer by layer. We demonstrate the usage and
post-processing technique of this sheet.

Advances in digital fabrication techniques such as 3D
printers have made it possible to create 3D objects accurately
and cheaply. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers, in
particular, have become famous and available on the market
owing to several advantages: ease of use, choice of materials,
and low running cost. In association with this advance, new
and interesting printing techniques utilizing the
characteristics of FDM have been proposed (e.g., printing
hair-like structures [3] and spiral printing for generative art
[2]). On the other hand, many researchers focus on printing
quality because the aesthetics of look and feel is one of the
most important features for printed objects [1, 5]. However,
to print high-quality objects, most techniques require an
expensive printer or long printing time. Objects printed by
FDM have a rough and uneven surface, which is called the
staircase effect [4].

CONTROLLING THICKNESS

The basic idea of controlling thickness is to increase the
amount of material extruded during printing. To control the
amount of material, we edit Gcode that contains the
commands used to control CNC machines including 3D
printers. In Gcode, G1 controls the movement of the printer
head and uses an E parameter that controls the amount of
material extruded between the starting and ending points. We
can increase the amount of material used by increasing the E
value. However, as the thickness of an object increases, the
amount of material extruded in one second is increased. This
condition of printers is essential for printing at high speed.
Thus, the limit on the speed of the stepper motor built into
the extruder become problematic. To decide the ideal F

parameter (i.e., extrusion speed) for every thickness, we must
clarify the features of the extruder.
In order to find the limits of the extruder, we define the
extrusion rate [mm3/s], which is the volume extruded in one
second. We weigh the extruded object to calculate the
extrusion rate using digital scales. We determine the
maximum extrusion rate, which is utilized to decide on the
ideal extrusion speed, by comparing the requested extrusion
with the actual extrusion.
Our technique uses two equations to set parameters. In the
equations, let Height, Width, and Length be the scale of an
object being printed. The E and F parameters are calculated
as follows:
E=

𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 × 𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ × 𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ
𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠‐ 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑜𝑓 𝐹𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡

𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝐸𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒
× 60
F ≤
𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 × 𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ

The maximum extrusion rate is obtained by conducting an
experiment. We conducted the experiment using NinjaBot
NJB-200 3D printer (http://ninjabot.jp/), and the maximum
extrusion rate was approximately 11 mm3/s. This means that
the printer can extrude with the requested rate up to 11 mm3/s.
Using these equations, we implemented a system that
generates Gcode using several parameters: size of sheet,
number of bumps, and height of a bump. Gcode generated by
our system is divided into micromovements for changing the
thickness dynamically (Figure 2). Three-dimensional
printers allow their heads to move obliquely, but they cannot
control the amount of material corresponding to the height.

a tactile sheet (Figure 3, bottom). The size of the sheet is
freely adjustable according to the parameters used. NJB-200
has a 200 × 200-mm build platform, and we confirmed that
our technique can be applied to every size. Note that the
largest sheet (200 × 200 mm) takes two hours to print.
Application
These printed sheets can be easily cut using
scissors or a laser cutter (Figure 4, left). By cutting as
required, we can utilize these sheets to assist with daily needs.
For example, a sheet printed with flexible filament can be
used as a coaster (Figure 4, center). This printed coaster is
not only cut into a round shape to fit glasses, but also
provides an antiskid function. This sheet can be also attached
to existing objects. We attached it to a watch strap to change
the feeling when touched into something resembling
alligator hide (Figure 4, right).

EXAMPLES

We show the example objects created while applying our
technique. To print example objects, we used NJB-200 and
set the temperature of the printer head and build platform to
the recommended value for each material.

CONCLUSION

We presented a technique that controls the thickness of
objects being printed, and showed example objects and their
usage. Like all printing techniques, our idea has limitations.
The thickness in our technique depends on the performance
of the 3D printer and the characteristics of the material.
Although we showed that several materials can be used, it is
necessary to analyze each factor in further detail. We will
also investigate the features of objects printed using this
technique (e.g., printing tactile cues).

Various Materials
We used eight available materials:
MakerBot ABS, PolyPlus PLA, flexible, polywood, copper,
magnetic iron PLA, carbon, and graphene (Figure 3, top).
We confirmed that our basic idea, which changes the
thickness of an object dynamically, can be applied to all of
the materials. In particular, PLA and flexible filaments were
printed cleanly without staircase effects or damage to the
aesthetic appearance. As shown in Figure 1b, the flexible one
can be bent by hand, and all linear objects in the structure
adhere to each other. These materials are suitable for printing
