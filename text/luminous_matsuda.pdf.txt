Abstract
People with hard of hearing and the deaf often face
difficulties to recognize things happening in their
surroundings. Imagine you cannot hear the sound,
because you are with hard of hearing or using iPod with
earphones, you would not able to recognize the car
coming behind of you. It may cause a fatal collision. The
purpose of this study is to develop the device mostly for
the deaf or hard of hearing people, for persons temporarily
with hard of hearing besides.
The device can be applied to multi modal accessibility,
which transforms the sound information to the visual
information. It also provides the direction to the sound
source using a light. The device is compact in an attempt
to be used in everyday life.

Introduction
People with hard of hearing, or hearing impaired, and the
deaf often face difficulties to recognize things happening
in their circumstances. Fire alarm, for instance, sounding
the imminent danger, is not accessible to those people.
American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of
The Rehabilitation Act require alert systems visually
accessible to those at hotels and motels, like other places
of public accommodation[6, 7, 2].
The ratio of senior citizens, age 65 and over, is increasing
in the global community. Japan in particular is the fastest
country in terms of aging. Its ratio of this age group to
the entire population is 25.1% (as of Oct. 1, 2013), which
is the highest in the world. The fail of the hearing
function by aging makes elderly people difficult to obtain
various auditory information.
Disability is caused by not only nature but situation.
Imagine you hold bags on your both hands. You are not
able to use your hands for other purposes. This difficulty
is similar to what a person with paralysis has.
When we focus on the deaf or hard of hearing, listening
music in large volume and/or concentrating on a
smartphone are/is same as disability. When you cannot
hear the sound, you are no longer recognizing a car
coming behind.
It has been proposed that the danger prediction method
using sound localization[5, 4]. However, no device is yet
actually suggested. An alert device and an accident
prevention device have been demanded[1, 8]. While the

device for visual disorder is already developed as Forehead
Sensory Recognition System[3], no device for the deaf and
hard of hearing people is found.
In this study, authors propose the alert device for the deaf
and hard of hearing people. The device offers both sound
localization and alert function.
In addition, considering the property of this device as both
an attention awakening device and an everyday device,
this device’s portability and usability must be considered
when determining its shape and size.

Device
The device architecture is elaborated in the following
sections.
Device Architecture
The device consists of a sound localization unit using
microphone array and an alert unit.(fig1). An alert unit is
using not only light by LED but also another component
such as vibrator, speaker or another ’human acceptable’
component for this propose.
A sound localization unit and an alert unit are separated
but these are connected by radio.
Usage
A user puts the alert device and the microphone array on
his/her body or belongings. Once something happening
with certain sound occurs around a user, the sound
localization unit detects the direction which the sound
comes from. The result of the detection is notified to the
alert unit so that it presents the information using alerting
component such as flash light.

Discussion
Separating the sound localization unit and the alert unit
gives great advantages to this device.
These advantages make the device possible to be equipped
for various use cases. The alert unit attached on glasses,
for instance, makes this device as a wearable alert system.
Another way to use this device is to notice the situation in
the remote place. For example, when an alert unit is
attached to a baby, a person in the next room is able to
find something happening around the baby.

Figure 1: Schematic diagram of device usage.

Prototyping
Prototype device is in fig.2. An alert unit using light by
LED and a sound localization unit are connected over
smartphone by Bluetooth LE.

Furthermore, the alert unit is attached to a person (User
A) and the sound localization unit is attached to another
person (User B), User B is able to call User A when User
B gets lost.
Separating the localization unit and the alert unit lets us
use several components corresponding to various user
experience. LED is able to provide the direction using
light, vibrators can provide it using haptics and so on.

Conclusion
Authors developed the device, which offers the sound
localization and the alert function using light. Separating
the sound localization unit and the alert unit creates
various use cases and frees users from places. Further
studies on this device are in progress. Details will be
described, the device and some use cases will be
demonstrated at iHAI 2014.
