ABSTRACT
Mental imagery is a quasi-perceptual experience emerging
from past experiences. In sports psychology, mental imagery
is used to improve athletes’ cognition and motivation. Eminent athletes often create their mental imagery as if they
themselves are the external observers; such ability plays an
important role in sport training and performance. Mental
image visualization refers to the representation of external
vision containing one’s own self from the perspective of others. However, without technological support, it is difficult
to obtain accurate external visual imagery during sports. In
this paper, we have proposed a system that has an aerial vehicle (a quadcopter) to capture athletes’ external visual imagery. The proposed system integrates various sensor data
to autonomously track the target athlete and compute camera angle and position. The athlete can see the captured
image in realtime through a head mounted display, or more
recently through a hand-held device. We have applied this
system to support soccer and other sports and discussed how
the proposed system can be used during training.

and Hardy have defined mental imagery as: An experience
that mimics real experience. We can be aware of “seeing”
an image, feeling movements as an image, or experiencing
an image of smell, tastes, or sounds without actually experiencing the real thing... It differs from dreams in that we
are awake and conscious when we form an image [14].
Although the mechanism of mental imagery is still under debate [1], mental imagery serves two functions in sport
because of the many possibilities of its usage [10]. One is
motivational imagery, which is related to individual goals
and physiological arousal emotions. The other is cognitive
imagery, which includes images of specific sport skills, strategies and game plans. Athletes can imagine the execution of
a skill from the perspective of an external observer as if they
are watching themselves as the spectators in the stands (external visual imagery) [7].
The important point is that one’s own self is seen in external visual imagery. This is because external visual imagery
mediates visual and internal kinesthetic information. For
example, during goal-directed reaching, visual information
is an important aid for remapping sensory-detected arm positions [13]. It is easy to get visual information about motor

behavior except behind oneself. Thus, athletes have to use
external visual imagery for integrating kinesthetic and visual
information in an environment lacks mirrors, videotapes, or
coaching.
Visual imagery vividness is an important factor that contributes to effective sport skills [12]. However, it is difficult for nonprofessional athletes to vividly imagine external
visual imagery due to their lack of experience. Mental imagery forms an image that arises from memories not directly
from the sense organs [5]. Therefore, we have developed a
representation system for gaining visual experience from an
external point of view. We have adopted an aerial vehicle
camera system with the capability to track and pursue a
user (Figure 1). The user can see the camera vision as external visual imagery through a head mounted display or a
handheld device.

EXTERNAL VISUAL IMAGERY

Most of the research on imagery ability has focused on
processing imaginary mental visualizations, often referred to
as imagery perspective [7]. Athletes can imagine themselves
performing from the perspective of an external observer. For
using this imagery for visual-motor adaption, it must contains the athlete’s own image. One supporting subject is
that visual information contributes to motor accuracy [13].
When you reach for an object within your sight, sensory information about the spatial location of the target is used to
plan and initiate appropriate movements. We define “external visual imagery” as follows: It is external an vision from
the perspective of others, and it contains self-image.
External visual imagery experiences are perceived by their
subjects as echoes, copies, or reconstructions of actual perceptual experiences from their past. A eminent athlete can
assemble vivid external visual imagery from several previous
experiences, but it is difficult for nonprofessional athletes.
Therefore, we have developed a representation system that
facilitates the perception of external visual imagery.
We have proposed two representation methods: delayed
representation(Figure 2(a)) and real-time representation(Figure
2(b)). Delayed representation is a method that shows a user
his external visual imagery after capturing it. Real-time representation is a method used to show to a user his external
visual imagery in real-time. The user can combine external visual information and internal kinesthetic information
using a head mounted display.

camera view and its height, through a downside ultrasonic
sensor to the command-and-control PC. We have also added
a digital azimuth compass to estimate the absolute directions of the aerial vehicle and the track. The command-andcontrol PC estimates the aerial vehicle’s pathway using this
information. The aerial vehicle’s parameters, i.e., velocity,
height, and direction are controlled by the command-andcontrol PC. The user can also control the state of the aerial
vehicle, including its velocity, height, and relative angle using a portable device (Figure 3). For computing the relative
angle psi between the angles of the user theta and the aerial
vehicle phi, they equip each digital compass (Figure 4).

FLYING SPORTS ASSISTANT SYSTEM

We have developed a prototype system for capturing and
representing external visual imagery. This system includes
an aerial vehicle with an onboard camera for capturing external visual imagery and a command and a control PC that
computes its pathway. The aerial vehicle can autonomously
maintain a stable flight and follow commands sent by the
command-and-control PC. The command-and-control PC
sends navigation commands to the aerial vehicle according
to the information received from the aerial vehicle sensor
and user input.

Human Tracking

In order to visually represent external imagery, simultaneous user recognition and tracking is required. In this research, we have performed a color extraction and particle
filtering algorithm for human tracking. The system requires
the subject to wear a discriminative color suit (In this research, discriminative color is red). It determines and tracks
the subject by recognizing only a specific color. the captured
image data contains noise because of variable color. Particle
filter algorithm enables noise-robust tracking by observing
time-series data; further, it estimates the current and subsequent states of the tracked object [3].
We configured the system to initialize 1000 particles in
a QVGA-size (320 × 240 pixel) image obtained by the on-

RESULT

We applied this system to capture playing soccer and stair
climbing scenes as examples of delayed representation. It
could capture the sequence of a player dribbling the soccer
ball in the field and shooting it to score a goal (Figure 5).
It could also capture the stair climbing scene (Figure 6).
However, the examples of delayed representation had two
problems. In the soccer scene, the player had to dribble
the ball slowly because he ran faster than the aerial vehicle.
In the stair climbing scene, the aerial vehicle often aborted
height modulation due to the measurement error of the ultrasonic sensor.
The system also captured a practice running (Figure 7
(a)(b)) and swinging of a baseball bat (Figure 7 (c)(d))
scenes as real-time representations. the user could watch

DISCUSSION

Losing Presence Identity
After several experiences of realtime external visual imagery,
we found out that external visual imagery would distract
presence identity. It is unusual experiences of representation both ego-centric visual information and intrinsic kinesthetic information. Surely, using a more sophisticated display, including virtual reality displays, would provide immersive external visual imagery. However, the feeling of
losing reality may be natural while viewing external visual
imagery. In sports psychology, self-monitoring refers to selfconsciousness externalization [4]. To induce the feeling that
your body is no longer yours contributes to the composition
of a vivid external visual imagery.

Sports Training Application
During training, a performer uses feedback to detect errors
in his performance by comparing his movements with the
expected goal in order to improve the next attempt. Recent, advances in technology have made it possible to augment and improve the feedback that performers receive during training and competition [6]. For instance, for hammer
throw training, Ohta et al. proposed cybernetic training
using a few miniaturized sensors for biofeedback [9]. The
system propose by us exhibits the possibility of facilitating
real-time video feedback training for long-distance sports including marathons and cross-country skiing.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, in sport psychology, we have introduced
external visual imagery derived from mental imagery. We
have developed an external visual imagery representing system using an aerial vehicle. The results of the experiments
performed by us have shown that our system can be applied
to cybernetic training.
