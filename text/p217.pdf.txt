ABSTRACT

It offers 179 web-based services “channels”.

Most of the work on context-aware systems has focused on
the context of time, location, and activity. Previous studies
on the context flow have been primarily conducted on a
qualitative basis. This paper proposes a new approach
from a quantitative perspective. We gathered the data
from automated task service, “If This Then That (IFTTT)”,
and analyzed the sequential tasks in terms of event
occurrence in smart devices through association rule
mining. We found out three consecutive tasks in crossapplications. The results of analysis have potential to find
hidden use patterns as telling what kinds of services and
channels are associated with each other. The findings
provide some insights on the development of design
guidelines for context-aware services.

Association Rules

Association rules is a method for discovering interesting
patterns between items from given transaction data [1].
Typical association rule mining is a rule of the form A ⟹ B,
where A, B ⊆ I, and A ∩ B ≠ ∅. The set of items, itemsets A is
called antecedent, while B is consequent. In order to find
out interesting rules from the set of all possible rules, userspecified minimum support and minimum confidence are
fixed [2]. There are valuation standards in result of association
rule: support, confidence and lift. Support is defined as the
percentage of records containing itemsets 𝐴 and 𝐵 together to
the total number of records in the database. Confidence is the
percentage of records containing items 𝐴 that also
contain items 𝐵 . Lift represents a measure of the distance
between (𝐵|𝐴) and (𝐵), or equivalently, the extent to which 𝐴
and 𝐵 are not independent [1].

METHODOLOGY

ACM Classification Keywords

We identified user behavior patterns in cross-application
through Apriori algorithm among association rule mining
using R. Apriori is a seminal algorithm as it is based on prior
knowledge of frequent itemset properties [2]. We supposed
association rules could reveal a correlation between trigger
channels and action channels, in addition, the cause-and-effect
relationship between the two channels. We gathered 641
recipes downloaded more than thousand times in IFTTT

(http://www.ifttt.com). We separated
channels in recipes to trigger and action channels, and then

INTRODUCTION

Using various devices and applications is extremely common
to perform their tasks in recent years. Thus, more research
regarding the contextual task flow is needed in order to
productivity improvement of task. The purpose of this study is
proposing an approach to analysis of the task flow in crossapplication, and then understanding user’s mental model of
use patterns depending on the context. However, contextawareness information has been the focus of time and location
[3]. Furthermore, previous studies have been conducted with
subjective methods such as observations, interviews,
and survey [5, 6]. The latest used application is important hint
to predict subsequent used application by user [3]. Therefore,
this approach using association rule is significant as focusing
on user’s sequential task depending on events occurred.

classified the trigger channels according by functionality on
the basis of IFTTT. Provided that support and confidence are
high, it is indicative of strong connection and causation
[3]. Suppose there are 𝐴 , 𝐵 , and 𝐶 channels. If confidence
𝑃(𝐶|𝐵) is greater than 𝑃(𝐵|𝐶), then it can be interpreted that
channel 𝐴, 𝐵, and 𝐶 are performed in a sequence (Figure 1).
We set two thresholds, minimal support and minimal
confidence to 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively.

If This, Then That

IFTTT (If This Than That) is automated task service. IFTTT
executes specify tasks (That) when pre-specified events
occurrence (This). There are “trigger” channels and “action”
channels to create “recipes” that accomplish the specific tasks.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Productive

The result suggests that when an event of productive channel
happens, users use Facebook page and then Facebook or
Twitter (Table 1).

CONCLUSION

We approached the quantitative analysis method to predict
expected three-process tasks between cross-applications
utilizing association rule mining. This study analyzed IFTTT
recipes categorized by functional application. Therefore, the
quantitative analysis result can interpret the sequential tasks in
smart environment.

Photo and Video

In this category, social network channels like Facebook,
Twitter and Tumblr occupy consequent most. It seems that
community managers and blog editors use IFTTT to organize
blog or social network posts. Thus, it found out users would
store photos and videos on cloud service safely and then share
on various social network (Table 2).

The analysis has potential to illustrate what kinds of services
and channels are associated with each other, thus telling us
about what cross-application interactions and behaviors are
common. These reported outcomes give insights into the
development of design guidelines for context-aware services.
It also contributes to predict patterns of users’ behavior
according to the context of use in smart devices. Moreover,
the suggested approach can appropriate as a preliminary step
to understand user’s task flow for a large-scale project of
developing user interfaces.

It shows when mobile channels satisfy conditions, IFTTT
saves data on Dropbox or Google drive. After that, it sends
user an email to notify the information or result (Table 3).

In accordance with the result, users publish same contents in
blogs and social networks in order. IFTTT can upload the
same contents to other social network as a marketing tool to
reduce repetitive tasks (Table 4).
