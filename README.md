acamap aims to mapping academic papers from a data-driven approach. Current academic research is far behind from the result of itself and are not organized. acamap help researchers to grasp the map of acamdeic papers by computationally analize each papers and visualize them into a graph where close papers are closely positioned. This repo contains several tools required to do it. Word2vec, scholar.py are the two main components.
