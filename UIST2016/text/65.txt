ABSTRACT

A
long-standing
challenge
of
video-mediated
communication systems is to correctly represent a remote
participant’s gaze direction in local environments. To
address this problem, we developed a video communication
system using an "eye-shaped display." This display is made
of an artificial ulexite (TV rock) that is cut into a
hemispherical shape, enabling the light from the bottom
surface to be projected onto the curved surface. By
displaying a simulated iris onto the eye-shaped display, we
theorize that our system can represent the gaze direction as
accurately as a real human eye.

remote participant’s face orientation and synchronizes
MeBot’s head orientation. The researchers expected these
face displays to have the ability to provide gaze awareness;
however, Kawaguchi et al. determined that even with a
rotatable display, it is not easy to represent remote
participant’s gaze direction properly [10].

INTRODUCTION

Gaze is one of the most important factors in human
communication [7, 9, 12]. For example, eye contact plays an
important role in turn taking in face-to-face communication.
In the case of video communication, however, the gaze
direction of remote participants cannot be represented
properly on a display, which undermines certain
collaborative tasks between the participants [8]. This effect
is called the Mona Lisa effect [4], which is a phenomenon
that causes the eyes in a portrait to appear to follow observers
as they move.

Some researchers have developed a system that utilizes a 3D
face-shaped screen with a 3D motion platform [3, 13].
Theoretically, such screens are effective in reducing the
Mona Lisa effect; however, a limitation with the system is
the lack of general versatility because each screen needs to
be made such that it matches the remote participant’s face. A
simpler approach is attaching a motor-operated eye [14] to a
video conferencing system. However, adding extra actuators
inevitably decreases the simplicity of the system.

To address this problem, telepresence robots that use LCDs
as face displays have been proposed [1, 11]. For example,
MeBot [1] has a three-degrees of freedom (3DOF) movable
display (head) and two 3DOF arms. The system detects the

In our study, we propose an eye-shaped display that imitates
the shape of a human eye ball and adds to a video
communication system as an auxiliary. Brockmeyer et al.
proposed to create the eye-shaped display using 3D printed
light pipes [2]. We created our eye-shaped display from a
ulexite (TV rock) (Figure 1). We theorize that this display
may contribute to increasing gaze direction perception of the
remote participant during video communication. For the
remainder of this paper, we describe the development of our
eye-shaped display and outline possible use cases.

EYE-SHAPED DISPLAY

Figure 1 shows our eye-shaped display. We made this
display by cutting a commercially available artificial ulexite

65

into a hemispherical shape. Ulexite has a characteristic that
it can project an image from the bottom surface to the
opposite surface. As a result, the image appears to float on
the spherical surface. For example, drawing a moving eye on
a flat LCD and placing the eye-shaped display on the LCD,
it looks as if the eye ball is rotating.
Given that the average diameters of a human eye ball and an
iris are 24 mm and 12 mm, respectively [5], our eye-shaped
display and its iris were made to match these sizes. The shape
of the iris that is drawn on the LCD is calculated so that it
becomes a true circle when it appears on the surface of the
eye-shaped display. Figure 2 shows the schematic diagram
for calculating the contour of the iris on the LCD. Let us
assume that the initial position of the iris is at the zenith of
the sphere. In this case, a point on the contour of the iris 𝑝
⃗⃗⃗𝑖
can be easily calculated. When the eye ball is rotated, a
rotated vector is calculated as ⃗⃗⃗⃗
𝑝𝑖 ′ = 𝑝
⃗⃗⃗𝑖 𝑅(𝜃𝑦 ) 𝑅(𝜃𝑧 ), where
)
𝑅(𝜃𝑦 ) and 𝑅(𝜃𝑧 are rotation matrices around 𝑦 axis and 𝑧
axis, respectively. By taking only 𝑥 and 𝑦 coordinates of
⃗⃗⃗⃗
𝑝𝑖 ′ , the iris for rotated eye ball can be drawn on the LCD (xy plane).

APPLICATIONS

We are implementing a video-conference system using the
eye-shaped display (Figure 3). The gaze direction of the eyeshaped display is calculated by tracking a remote
participant's gaze direction using an eye tracker.
Theoretically, this method helps a local participant perceive
the remote participant's gaze direction accurately.

using eye-shaped display.

We are also planning to apply the eye-shaped display to a
remote instruction system, which uses a hand-held terminal
as a video see-through device [6]. When a remote instructor
wants to refer to an object that lies outside the view of the
device, the eye-shaped display indicates the direction toward
the object. We are expecting that the worker may
involuntarily react to such an eye movement and move the
device toward the gaze direction.
CONCLUSION

Figure 4. An example of a remote instruction system.

This paper proposes to use an eye-shaped display for a video
communication system that enables the local participant to
accurately estimate the remote participant's gaze direction.
Since this technology does not require additional electricity,
we believe it is especially useful for tablet terminals and
smartphones.
Our future work includes assessing the accuracy of
perceiving a remote participant gaze direction and also
examining the effect of adding an eyelid. Additionally, we
plan to investigate the effect of our eye-shaped display on
actual video communications.
