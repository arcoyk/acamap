We propose Electric Food Texture System, which can present
virtual food texture such as hardness and elasticity by electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to the masseter muscle. In our
previous study, we investigated the feasibility to detect user’s
bite with a photoreflector and that to construct database of
food texture with electromyography sensors. In this paper,
we investigated the feasibility to control virtual food texture
by EMS. We conducted an experiment to reveal the relationship of the parameters of EMS and those of virtual food texture. The experimental results show that the higher strength
of EMS is, the harder virtual food texture is, and the longer
duration of EMS is, the more elastic virtual food texture is.

INTRODUCTION

Some previous studies proposed to present and change food
texture by haptic technology for dining experiment improvement. There are two approaches, one is to use force feedback
on user’s teeth to change food texture directly [2], the other is
to use cross modal sensation to change food texture indirectly
[1, 3]. However, there are some limitations. The former approach has the limitations of scene; it cannot be used while
users are eating real food because haptic actuators are put in
their mouthes. The latter approach has the limitations of variety; it cannot control food texture of tender food like pasta
because it doesn’t make chewing sound.

have investigated the feasibility to detect user’s bite with a
photoreflector and that to construct database of food texture
with electromyography sensors. Thus, we describe the feasibility to control virtual food texture by EMS in this paper.
To control the parameters of virtual food texture such as hardness and elasticity, we have to investigate the relationship of
those of EMS and those of virtual food texture. Based on
texture profile analysis, our hypotheses are as follows [5].

Our motivation is to propose a novel method to present food
texture for more widely used. In [4], we propose to use
electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to the masseter muscle.
Pfeiffer, et al. showed EMS is useful to present hardness of
virtual objects [6]. Therefore, we suppose that it is also useful to present food texture such as hardness and elasticity. In
[4], we describe our proposal system; “Electric Food Texture
System” as shown in Figure 1. The system is composed of
“bite detection part”, “food texture database”, and “electric
stimulation part”. Virtual food texture is presented by EMS
to the masseter muscle synchronizing with user’s bite. We

2. The longer duration of EMS is, the more elastic virtual
food texture is.
We conducted an experiment to verify our hypotheses.
EXPERIMENT
Setup

A medical electrical stimulator (Digitimer, D185) is used for
EMS. This stimulator can control the voltage of electric stimulation. The square wave whose pulse width is 0.05 ms. The
trigger signal is sent from Arduino which is connected to bite
detection part to control frequency and duration of electric
stimulation. The strength of electric stimulation is controlled
by pulse frequency modulation; the higher frequency is, the
stronger electric stimulation is. Following safety standards

(JIS T 0601-2-10), the voltage is less than 20 V and the current is less than 10 mA. We use small electrodes (Nihon Kohden, F-150S) whose size is 18 × 36 mm to stimulate only
the masseter muscle. They are put on the right masseter muscle. The calibration is conducted to decide the positions of
them for each subject. The positions are shown in Figure 2.

controlled by strength of EMS and that of elasticity can be
controlled by duration of EMS.
CONCLUSION

We propose to present EMS to the masseter muscle for virtual
food texture. In this paper, we investigated the relationship of
the parameters of EMS and those of virtual food texture. The
experimental results show that the higher strength of EMS is,
the harder virtual food texture is, and the longer duration of
EMS is, the more elastic virtual food texture is. In future
works, we will propose applications such as virtual dining
experience and augmented dining experience.

Procedure

5 males and 1 female (20s - 30s) participated in this experiment. First, we investigated the relationship of frequency and
hardness. The duration is fixed at 150 ms. The frequency is
set as 100,150, 200, or 250 Hz. The procedure is as follows.
1. The frequency of EMS is chosen randomly from 100 Hz
to 250 Hz as 1st stimulation. Subjects move their jaws 5
times and the electric stimulation is presented for each bite
when the mouth is closing.

16K00266 by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

2. The different frequency of EMS is chosen as 2nd stimulation. They move their jaws 5 times and the electric stimulation is presented for each bite when the mouth is closing.

3. Subjects are asked to rate in which stimulation they feel
harder food texture using Scheffe’s pairwise comparison
whose rating scale is 7-point.
Each subject tried 6 combinations of 1st and 2nd stimulation.
Next, we investigated the relationship of duration and elasticity. The frequency is fixed at 150 Hz. The duration is set as
100, 150, 200, or 250 ms. The procedure is the same as the
investigation of hardness.
Results

The result of hardness is shown in Figure 3 and that of elasticity is shown in Figure 4. In Figure 3, the higher frequency
is, the harder virtual food texture is. Frequency has a main
effect (F (3, 15) = 33.3, p < .01) and there are significant
difference between 100 - 150 Hz (p < .01), 100 - 200 Hz
(p < .01), 100 - 250 Hz (p < .01), and 150 - 250 Hz (p < .05)
by multiple comparisons. In Figure 4, the longer duration is,
the more elastic virtual food texture is. Duration has a main
effect (F (3, 15) = 54.5, p < .01) and there are significant
difference between 100 - 150 ms (p < .01), 100 - 200 ms
(p < .01), 100 - 250 ms (p < .01), 150 - 200 ms (p < .01),
and 150 - 250 ms (p < .01) by multiple comparisons. These
results suggest that hardness of virtual food texture can be
